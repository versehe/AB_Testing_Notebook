## Asymptotics
Asymptotics means that sample size limits to infinity. It forms the basis of frequency interpretation of probability. For example, if we flip a coin for infinitely many times, we would get exactly 50% heads. The property of this called Law of Large Number.


### Law of Large Number
Law of Large Number(LLN) says the sample mean is consistent to the population mean if you repeat the experiment infinite times. So does sample variance and sample std.

### Central Limit Theorem
Central Limit Theorem(CLT) states that the distribution of averages is often normal, even if the distribution that the data is being sampled from is very non-normal. This helps us create robust strategies for creating statistical inferences when we're not willing to assume much about the generating mechanism of our data.
