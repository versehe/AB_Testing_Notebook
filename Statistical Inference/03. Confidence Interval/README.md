## Asymptotics
Asymptotics means that sample size limits to infinity. It forms the basis of frequency interpretation of probability. For example, if we flip a coin for infinitely many times, we would get exactly 50% heads. The property of this called Law of Large Number.


### Law of Large Number
Law of Large Number(LLN) says the sample mean is consistent to the population mean if you repeat the experiment infinite times. So does sample variance and sample std.

### Central Limit Theorem
Central Limit Theorem(CLT) states that as sample size increase, random variable roughly becomes standard normal. When sample size n is large enough, then a normal distribution Z ~ N(u,Ïƒ<sup>2</sup>) is close enought to a standard normal distribution(Z ~ N(0,1)). Same thing happens to binomial distribution and others.
