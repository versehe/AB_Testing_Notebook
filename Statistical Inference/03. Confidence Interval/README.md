## Asymptotics
Asymptotics means that sample size limits to infinity. It forms the basis of frequency interpretation of probability. For example, if we flip a coin for infinitely many times, we would get exactly 50% heads. The property of this called Law of Large Number.


### Law of Large Number
Law of Large Number(LLN) says the sample mean is consistent to the population mean if you repeat the experiment infinite times. So does sample variance and sample std.

### Central Limit Theorem
Central Limit Theorem(CLT) states that the distribution of averages is often normal, even if the distribution that the data is being sampled from is very non-normal. This helps us create robust strategies for creating statistical inferences when we're not willing to assume much about the generating mechanism of our data. 

该定理说明，当n很大时，随机变量
近似地服从标准正态分布N(0，1)。因此，当n很大时，
近似地服从正态分布N(nμ，nσ2)．该定理是中心极限定理最简单又最常用的一种形式，在实际工作中，只要n足够大，便可以把独立同分布的随机变量之和当作正态变量。这种方法在数理统计中用得很普遍，当处理大样本时，它是重要工具。 [2]
