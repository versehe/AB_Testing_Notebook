## Hypothesis testing
Hypothesis test is about making decisions using data.                  
```Null Hypothesis H<sub>0</sub>```: Null Hypothesis is assumed to be true until statistical evidence rejects it.            
```Alternative Hypothesis H<sub>a</sub>```: This usually is our research interest, we want to prove it makes a difference than normal.    
Through the test, if we draw a conclusion of H<sub>0</sub> is true, then we accept null; if we draw a conclusion of H<sub>a</sub> is true, then we reject null. 

### Type 1 and Type 2 Error
```Type 1 Error```:we shouldn't reject null but we did, we draw a conclusion of H<sub>a</sub> but it's actually H<sub>0</sub>. This is the worst because we think it will make a difference but it's actually not going to happen.                           
```Type 2 Error```:failed to reject null, we draw a conclusion of H<sub>0</sub> but it's actually H<sub>a</sub>. In this case, there is actually a difference but we didn't notice it.
