### What is Probability?      
Probability assigns a number between 0 and 1 to events to give a sense of the "chance" of the event. 

The probability of two things that cannot simultaneously occur(mutually exclusive) is the sum of their respective probabilities.     
P(A∪B) = P(A) + p(B)    
Otherwise, if these two things can happen simultaneously, the probability that at least one occurs is the sum of their probabilities minus their intersection.    
P(A∪B) = P(A) + p(B) - P(A∩B)
