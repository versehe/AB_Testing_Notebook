This is a personal note for Coursera Class Statistical Inference:      
https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inference/home/week/1            
      
There is some official Class notes in their Github:

However, I personally am not a big favor on their detailed-oriented notes. So I kept it by myself.
