AB testing for beginners

### What is AB testing?
In a word, ab testing is an experiment that randomly split your users into 2 or multiple groups, and test whether your product new feature could hit a better performance. Users view original product/page are called "Control group", and users view new features are called "Variation Group". Generally, you don't want too many variations for a single test, because the more variations created, the higher possibility it could fall out of confidence interval.

### When not to use AB testing?
AB testing is great to test whether this feature could help improve your business goal or not. But it could'n tell you what else feature you should add. The experiment group needs to be radomly assigned, you need to worry about things like network effects. Also, if the user reaction is too long or hard to track, then you couldn't find a significant difference from your result.

For example:
I want to figure out what product I could add to my website.
A car dealer try to prompt special coupon to attract repeative purchase or word of mouth.
Website logo change.
Give cupcakes samples to a local communuity to test best flavor.
